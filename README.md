This wheelchair is designed for the disabled who depend on other for helping them to go from one place to another. This concept helps them move on wheelchairs from one place to another on their own without any external help. They can simply control the wheel chair by simple gesture be it hands or even head. This removes the limitations of wheelchair needing some external help to move and make it freely to move for them with limited mobility.
This project is divided into two parts: - 
One is used to monitor gesture and send it to the module controlling the drives for wheelchair,
Arduino Uno is being used to monitor the data and act accordingly, 
Two NRF24L01 units are used for the communication of a signal from the MPU6050 unit, which is used to accurately detect the movements of hands or head, the data is sent wirelessly to the Uno and it responds accordingly to the hand movement .
